THE ASSIGNMENT TIME WAS THIRTY FIVE TO FOURTHY HOURS.
WHILE DEVELOPING THE PAGE I WAS HELPED BY THE TUTOR IN THE CLASS AND W3SCHOOLS AND I INSPIRED BY HTTPS://JOEL.SH.ABOUT.

THE PAGE "HOME" REFERS TO INDEX.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES THE TITLE "HOME". ALSO CONTAINS THREE PHOTOS WHICH ARE LINKS AND ANCHORS TOO. THE FIRST BIGER PHOTO HAS A TEXT IN THE PICTURE. THE OTHER TWO PHOTOS HAVE A TEXTNAME WHICH ARE LINKS AND ANCHORS TO THE PAGES "RESUME" AND "BIOGRAPHY". THERE IS TEXT IN A FRAME WHICH HAS AN ANCHOR TO THE PAGE "CONTACT".

THE PAGE "CV" REFERS TO CV.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES A TITLE "MY RESUME". MOREOVER, IT CONTAINS MY HANDLE NAME, A SUMMARY TEXT WITH DETAILS ABOUT ME.THERE IS A FEW DETAILS ABOUT EDUCATION. THERE IS ALSO A REFERENCE TO PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE WITCH IS AN UNORDER LIST.

THE PAGE "BIOFRAPHY" REFERS TO BIO.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES A TITLE "BIOGRAPHY" AND A TEXT WITH A BIOGRAPHY ABOUT ME.

FINALY, THE PAGE "CONTACT" REFERS TO CONTACT.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES A SHORT TEXT WHICH IS IN A PARAGRAPH AND STATICS FORMS WITH LABELS, WHICH ARE MY CONTACT BOXES. IN THAT FORMS SOMEONE CAN WRITE CONTACT ELEMENTS AND SEND AN EMAIL OR A MESSAGE TO ME IF HE WANTS. ASLO, THERE IS A FEW MORE CONTACT DETAILS, WHICH INCLUDES ICONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION LIKE MY PHONE NUMBER, MY EMAIL, FACEBOOK, AND MY GIT ACCOUNT.

ALL THE HTML PAGES INCLUDE HEADER WHICH CONTAINS A TITLE WITH THE SPECIFIC PAGE AS I WROTE BEFORE, A NAV BANNER WITH LINKS TO THE OTHER PAGES "RESUME","BIOGRAPHY","CONTACT", "HOME" AND ITSELF. THERE IS ALSO A FOOTER WHICH CONTAINS FOUR LINKS WITH ICONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION.

ALL HTML PAGES CONTAINS GOOGLE WEBFONT API AND ICONS. FOR THE COLORS TO BANNER AND FOOTER I WAS INFLUENC BY "MATERIAL DESIGN UI STYLE GUIDE". FINALLY IN THE CSS FILE IS USED ANIMATION TECHNIQUES.

WHEN A START TO CREATE MY PAGES I START WITH THE HEADERS AND THE FOOTERS, AFTER THAT I TRY TO FIX THE STYLE IN CSS FILE THAT WAS DIFFUCULT BECAUSE I HAVE ONE CSS FILE FOR ALL HTML PAGES. I HAVE SEVERAL LISTS AND I COULD NOT TO GIVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICTS TO EACH ONE UNTIL TO REALISE THAT I HAD TO PUT DIFFERENT CLASS.

THERE WAS SOME ISSUES WITH PHOTOS WHICH SOLVE QUITE EASY AND I FOUND EXTRAORDINARY THAT MY TWO SMALLER PHOTOS WAS A LIST TOO, SO I SET THEM TO DISPLAY IN LIST.

I PASS ALL FILES TO VALIDATION.

I FIND WEB DEVELOPING VERY INTEREST AND I ENJOY THE ASSIGNMENT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
