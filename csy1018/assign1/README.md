I HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE UNORDER LIST-STYLE,I FIND IT DIFFUCULT TO HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS.FINALLY I FOUND IN W3SCHOLL THAT I CAN GIVE DIFFERENT NAME TO EACH LIST.AFTER THAT I HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE LI ELEMENTS.WHEN I TRY TO GIVE  A STYLE TO ONLY ONE UNORDER LIST ALL OFF THE LI (EVEN THESE WHICH NOT BELONG TO THE SPECIFIC UNORDER LIST) CHANGE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PROBLEM BECAUSE AFTER THE LI IS A NULL.
