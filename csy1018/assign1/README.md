I HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE UNORDER LIST-STYLE,I FIND IT DIFFUCULT TO HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS.FINALLY I FOUND IN W3SCHOLL THAT I CAN GIVE DIFFERENT VALUES-NAME TO EACH LIST.AFTER THAT I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE LI ELEMENTS.WHEN I TRY TO GIVE  A STYLE TO ONLY ONE UNORDER LIST ALL OTHE OTHERS LI (EVEN THESE WHICH NOT BELONG TO THE SAME UNORDER LIST) CHANGE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS ERROR BECAUSE AFTER THE LI THERE IS A SPACE.
