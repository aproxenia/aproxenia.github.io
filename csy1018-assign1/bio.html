<h1>About Mary</h1><!--tittle-->

<h3>But in real, who are you?</h3>
<p>
  I am a programmer, I know to use java, javascript, html, css and some other language too and I prefer to work to GitHub my projects, <br> since I can communicate with my colluages. I graduated from the University of Northampton, in which I studied computer science. I recently work in Medical company and we try to help old people using their mobile phones to save their life.
