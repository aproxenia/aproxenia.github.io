THE ASSIGNMENT TIME WAS THIRTY FIVE TO FOURTHY HOURS.
WHILE DEVELOPING THE PAGE I WAS HELPED BY THE TUTOR IN THE CLASS AND W3SCHOOLS.

THE PAGE "HOME" REFERS TO INTEX.HTML,WHICH INCLUDES THE TITLE "HOME". ALSO CONTAINS THREE PHOTOS WHICH ARE LINKS AND ANCHORS TOO. THE FIRST PIGER PHOTO HAS A TEXT IN THE PICTURE. THE OTHER TWO PHOTOS HAVE A TEXTNAME WHICH ARE LINKS AND ANCHORS TO THE PAGES "RESUME" AND "BIOGRAPHY". THERE IS TEXT IN A FRAME WHICH HAS AN ANCHOR TO THE PAGE "CONTACT".

THE PAGE "RESUME" REFERS TO RESUME.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES A TITLE "MY RESUME". MOREOVER, IT CONTAINS MY HANDLE NAME, A SUMMARY TEXT WITH DETAILS ABOUT ME.THERE IS A FEW DETAILS ABOUT EDUCATION WHICH ARE IN DIFFERENT PARAGRAPHS. THERE IS ALSO A REFERENCE TO PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE WITCH IS AN UNORDER LIST.

THE PAGE "BIOFRAPHY" REFERS TO BIO.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES A TITLE "BIOGRAPHY".ALSO, A TEXT WITH A BIOGRAPHY ABOUT ME.

FINALY, THE PAGE "CONTACT" REFERS TO CONTACT.HTML, WHICH INCLUDES A SHORT TEXT WHICH IS IN A PARAGRAPH AND FORMS WITH LABELS, WHICH ARE MY CONTACT BOXES. IN THAT BOXES SOMEONE CAN WRITE CONTACT ELEMENTS AND SEND AN EMAIL,A MESSAGE AND CONTACT WITH ME IF HE WANTS. ASLO, THERE IS A FEW MORE CONTACT DETAILS, WHICH INCLUDES ICONS AND CONDACT INFORMATION LIKE MY PHONE NUMBER,MY EMAIL,FACEBOOK, AND MY GIT ACCOUNT.

ALL THE HTML PAGES INCLUDE HEADER WHICH CONTAINS A TITLE WITH THE SPECIFIC PAGE AS I WROTE BEFORE, A BANNER WITH LINKS TO THE OTHER PAGES "RESUME","BIOGRAPHY","CONTACT", "HOME" AND ITSELF. THERE IS ALSO A FOOTER WHICH CONTAINS FOUR LINKS WITH ICONS AND CONTACT INFORMATION.

PAGES ALSO CONTAINS GOOGLE FONT AND ICONS AND FOR THE COLORS TO THE BANNER AND FOOTER I WAS INFLUENC BY "MATERIAL DESIGN UI STYLE GUIDE".

WHEN A START TO CREATE MY PAGES I START WITH THE HEADERS AND THE FOOTERS, AFTER THAT I TRY TO FIX THE STYLE IN CSS. FILE THAT WAS DIFFUCULT

VALIDATION
I HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE UNORDER LIST-STYLE,I FIND IT DIFFUCULT TO HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS.FINALLY I FOUND IN W3SCHOLL THAT I CAN GIVE DIFFERENT CLASS NAME TO EACH LIST.AFTER THAT I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE LI ELEMENTS.WHEN I TRY TO GIVE  A STYLE TO ONLY ONE UNORDER LIST ALL OTHE OTHERS LI (EVEN THESE WHICH NOT BELONG TO THE SAME UNORDER LIST) CHANGE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS ERROR BECAUSE AFTER THE LI THERE IS A SPACE.SO, I DECIDE TO MAKE A CLASS FOR MY LI AND THAT IS!IT WORKS!
